# CSV Fullstack Applikation 🚀

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **frontend** of a full-stack web application designed to upload CSV files containing user data and store them in a PostgreSQL database via a REST API built using .NET (C#). The frontend is developed using Angular (TypeScript) and implements form validation for user fields. Invalid fields are clearly displayed in a table for easy user identification. Additionally, the project includes automated unit tests for the frontend (using Jasmine), ensuring functionality and stability.

### Key Features 🛠️
- Upload CSV files containing user data 📂.
- Validate and display invalid user fields in a table format 📊.
- Store valid user data in a PostgreSQL database 🗄️.
- Implement form validation for the following fields:
  - Full name (max length: 100 characters) ✍️
  - Username (max length: 100 characters) 👤
  - Email (formatted as a valid email address) 📧
  - Password (must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, one special character, and be longer than 8 characters) 🔑
- Save valid data to the database 💾.
- Automated unit tests for the frontend 🧪.
